# Stray-Aid
This is a Final Year Project completed by me and my 2 other teammates, Dav and Shawn. Huge thanks to them for constantly guiding and helping me with my parts.

Stray Aid is a animal adoption website that mimics a social networking site for shelters and animal lovers/volunteers to engage with each other with the purpose of providing a shelter to the strays. 

The website consists of two users, with functions including:
* Normal users

  * View, edit account profile
  * Search shelters by name / post content / location
  * Submit and delete animal adoption application form
  * Message other users
